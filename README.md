Financial Data Warehouse ETL – SSIS Project

This repository implements an end-to-end ETL workflow for a financial data warehouse using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS).

🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a complete Extract–Transform–Load (ETL) pipeline for financial data, following a structured data-warehouse design.
It is based on the tutorial:
“Learn SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) – Complete Beginner’s Guide to ETL”

The solution simulates a small financial data warehouse, including staging, transformations, and loading of fact/dimension tables.
